# Welcome

Hello, and welcome to my Leaf Village landing page.

I will be documenting my projects, experiences and learning for everybody to see (and probably not enjoy..). 
I joined the IT indusutry back in 2021 after 8+ years working in the fitness industry as a multi-site gym manager, boxing and pilates coach and general fitness fanatic!

During the first of many lockdown I realised I had fallen out of love with the fitness industry and decided to spend time meditating and evaluating what my true passion is; gaming. Naturally this led me to investigate what I enjoyed about gaming .. and discovered it wasn't just racking up back to back wins on Halo, COD and the likes.

Subsequently I then took advantage of the furlough and embarked on my career switch, where I enrolled on various online courses for the A+, N+, S+ CCNA and more. 

I now work as a Cloud Infrastructure Specialist and have turned my personal studies more towards Cyber Security/InfoSEC - where I am currently studying towards my AZ500 before moving on to the CCSK which I hope to begin in April.

## Spoiler alert

* I will be documenting my learning for the AZ500 throughout my studies!
* I have far too many courses to complete in my Udemy account.
* Madara gets betrayed by Zetsu (& this hurt)
